## MozFest Open Projects


> *Lessons and exercises in this manual are adapted from Mozilla's [Open Leadership Training Series](http://mzl.la/open-leadership). Enroll in the course to get a full introduction to Open Leadership.*


Does your MozFest session involve hands-on, project based learning? This training is for anyone running an open project at MozFest. This can be software, curriculum, or anything you can build together with a group.

Weâ€™ll go over the basics of open leadership and running a collaborative project including project setup on GitHub and preparing for contributions. By applying best practices from open source, your project will be more welcoming and sustainable. This will help you engage more contributors during MozFest and sustain momentum after the festival. **All projects that complete this training will be featured on [Network Pulse](https://mozilla.github.io/network-pulse/) at MozFest.**
