When you are “working open” you use the power, knowledge, and skills of a diverse community of volunteers (called “contributors”) to accomplish something that a single person or a small team couldn’t do alone.

When your project is “open” you share knowledge and information generated by the project widely and freely, allow others to build on your project, and maximize its usefulness for everyone.

By working open, we can often get far more done (and often done better) than we could working alone. And the knowledge, resources, and tools we generate in our work are more useful and powerful because they’re shared widely.

Take a look at Mozilla's [Introduction to Open Leadership](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/) to learn more about Working Open and running an open project.
