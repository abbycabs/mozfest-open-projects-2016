We've created a [set of templates](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template) to help you get started on your project repository. You'll need to fork or clone the repository (or repo) to start using the templates. This exercise will walk you through forking the repo.

If you already have a project repository, take a quick look at the template before you move on to the next section.

Template: [https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template)

A fork is your own copy of a GitHub repository that you can edit and change however you like. A repository is a collection of files and history on your project. GitHub helps people work together and collaborate around a project.

#### 1. Fork the repo

To fork the templates, click on the **Fork** button on the repository page. It should be in the top right corner.

You should now have your own version of the templates in your account. You should be able to find it at `https://github.com/[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]/mozfest-repo-template`.

#### 2. Change the name of your fork

To use this repository for your own project, it should be named properly!

Go to the settings tab in your fork. It should be rightmost tab in the repository. You can also go to the url `https://github.com/[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]/mozfest-repo-template/settings`.

When you're ready to save your changes, scroll down to a section called **Commit changes**. Add a message summarizing your change. Then click on the green **Commit changes** button.
