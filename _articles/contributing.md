>*In this activity you will learn how to create and maintain a CONTRIBUTING.md for an open source project.*

Contributor guidelines, which we’ll write in a file we’ll call CONTRIBUTING.md, are the nuts and bolts instructions on how to contribute to your project.


### 1. Reflect / Plan
Start by reflecting on what to include, and what kinds of contributions to invite.

The following elements should appear in your CONTRIBUTING file. If you don’t know the details right now, it’s OK to write “more details coming soon!” for that section. Remember, you’ll often return to this document to update it as your project evolves. Take a few notes as you read through the list, plan and reflect.

1. **Restate your project vision**, in one sentence. Redundancy is your friend!
2. **Welcome contributors to the project**: Let them know that you are eager for contributions and happy that they’ve come. This is a great place to introduce yourself so people see that there’s a name and face that goes with this project.
3. **Point people to your Code of Conduct** for the project, and require users to read it before they go any further.
4. **List Important Resources** where contributors can see what kind of work is currently happening on the project.
  * readme
  * roadmap
5. **List Communication Channels**: if you are using forums, chat clients, email lists or other ways of communicating about the project, list those here and provide instructions on how to join. This should also **let users know where to go for help**.
6. **Tell readers how to submit changes**: This is the process for adding your work or changes to the repository or collection of ongoing work.
7. **Describe Good First bugs for Contributors**:  Guidelines for the types of “bugs” or useful, helpful tasks new contributors should start with as they’re first coming on to a project. A bug often refers to a problem that needs to be fixed. These should be small, fairly easy but meaningful tasks that get a new contributor started and provide an early, encouraging success. For a very new project, a good first bug might be to ask contributors to comment on your README file-- does it make sense, do they understand the project? Is all the information they need there? Are there any typos?
8. **Tell readers how to report a bug**: Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. Basically, by asking users to report bugs, you’re asking for feedback on work that’s been done. Most projects invite all contributors to report, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
9. **Tell users about your recognition model** - Remember, you need to acknowledge value of the time and work your volunteers give your project. Here, provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for interest contributing. List any recognition contributors might receive for participating in your project. You can also outline how contributors can “level up” to become project maintainers (a certain number of bugs resolved, a certain number of changes or contributions successfully submitted to the project). You can leave this blank for now, and fill it in later.

Here are some elements that are optional for your CONTRIBUTING.MD file. See if any of these make sense for your project.

* **Info on how to request an "enhancement"** - enhancements are features that contributors suggest for a project, but aren't necessarily bugs/problems with the existing work; there is a "label" for enhancements in Github's Issues so contributors can tag issues as "enhancement" -- not the same priority as a bug or current task, but important as the community helps guide the project’s design and evolution.  See Atom's example section.
* **Style Guide / Coding conventions** - If your project is a coding project, it’s important to designate how the code should look. [See Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#suggesting-enhancements).
* **Who is involved?** - [Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). You might list the core contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/).

### 2. Write up your a CONTRIBUTING file
Now that you’ve reviewed what goes into the CONTRIBUTING file and given some thought to how you want newcomers to engage with your own project, take your notes and write up your own CONTRIBUTING file. This file should be titled CONTRIBUTING.md and should live in the root directory of your repository.
