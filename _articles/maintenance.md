Now that you've setup your project in that way that encourages new contritutors, and
brought your project to MozFest and engaged new contributors, it's time to work together on your awesome project!

In this section we'll talk about
1. Event follow-up & documentation
2. Collaborating online
3. Maintaining your project

### Event follow-up & documentation

It's important to followup with the people you interacted with at MozFest so they know how they can continue contributing to your project. If you have a way to contact people who attended your session, consider reaching out and inviting them to your GitHub repository. Here is a guide for [Organizing for Action After an Event](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/running-awesome-community-events/event-follow-up/#organizing-for-action-after-an-event).

Equally important is documenting your work. Not everyone is able to attend an in-person event! Collect all the notes, photos, or prototypes created during your session and consider placing them in your GitHub repo. By making your documentation discoverable, you can reach more people who might want to contribute to your work.

Here is an article on [Event Documenting & Reporting](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/running-awesome-community-events/documenting-and-reporting/) from our Open Leadership Training Series.

### Collaborating online

Once you leave MozFest, you can still work with all the contributors you met at the event! Since your project is on GitHub, you can follow our [GitHub for Collaboration](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/github-for-collaboration/) training for step-by-step workflows on interacting with your contributors.

### Maintaining your project
Once you've gotten started building your project with a few contributors, you can steward your project and its community by mentoring contributors and developing an explicit plan to maintain your projectâ€™s key content.

We cover these issues in [Meaningful Participation](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/understand-meaningful-participation-and-distributed-leadership/) and [Open Project Maintenance](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/open-project-maintenance/open-project-maintenance/).
